## Sea of Fury
Sea of Fury was a 3D 17th Century pirate ship game created for the 3D Games Programming Module during my first year. The basis of the game is that the player is controlling a pairate sail ships and is out on a contract to kills all other ships they see to get to the target score of 1000 points. Some enemy ships try to flee from the player and other ships are more agressive and will follow and shoot the player. The player only has one life and needs to be very careful to make sure their health is not wasted. The player can switch between left and right views of the cannon and a third person view of the ship as well as a mini map to navigate the waters and shoot accurately at enemy ships.
